## Game Instructions

- Two teams (**Guards & Thieves**) can compete in a match.

- Team can be **Duo** (2 players) or **Squad** (4 players).

- Start the game **Server** and choose the **Mode** (Duo/Squad).

- **Rooms** will be of different colors. You need to have **Swipe Card** matching the color of the room in order to access it's **Door**.

- **Loots**, weapons (Pistol & Knife) and swipe cards can be found on the floor.

- **Pistol** deal low damage but have high range. For **Knife**, it's vice versa.

- You can **Restore Health** using medicine from the **FAB** (Medicine is limited, so use wisely).

- When you knock down an opponent, he will loose all his loots and get **Locked up** in your **Prison**. You can collect his loot.

- Teammates can **Rescue** locked up players, provided they have swipe card of that prison.

- You can toggle (On/Off) the **Electricity** using the **Main Switch** to play out your strategy.

- Thieves try to steal items, whereas guards try to prevent it.

- Team which have either **(2 * mode) loots** or **(mode / 2) opponents in prison** will be declared the **Winner**.

- **`So, are you Ready or Not ‚ùì`**
